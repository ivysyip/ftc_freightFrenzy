# Multi-Threading
We used multi-threading during autonomous period to do multiple tasks at the same time to increase efficiency </br></br>
We mainly used it for the autonomous period as we found that there is a significant lag while using in the Tele-Operated period. We used [runToPosition](https://github.com/ivysyip/ftc_freightFrenzy/tree/main/Team%20Code/Sample%20Run%20To%20Position) mode on motors as a fake multi-threading solution during TeleOp instead.
